Greyhound is a fork of the famous [Wraith Archon](https://github.com/dtzxporter/WraithXArchon/) by DTZxPorter. It is an extraction tool for Call of Duty, supporting XModels, XAnims, Images, and more depending on the game. With Greyhound I hope to ensure updates to the tool for both current and future titles, and bring more features to aid in working with the games. This tool is developed to aid people modding other Call of Duty titles such as Black Ops III, and for people producing art such as renders!

For detailed information such as game support, settings, FAQs, etc. please refer to the wiki: [Wiki](https://github.com/Scobalula/Greyhound/wiki) Work is being done to populate the wiki with information and tutorials so stay tuned!
